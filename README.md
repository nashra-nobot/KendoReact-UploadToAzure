This application helps one, to Upload files to Azure Storage using Azure APIs and Kendo React Upload component. 

There are various restrictions (built-in and customized), used, which are checked right after the user selects some files (selecting multiple files is allowed) and only if they are valid, the upload starts automatically or else the an alert message pops up on top of the page. 

The component allows the user to either select files (using Select Files button) or drag 'n' drop feature. 

We can also see how we can change some default labels in the component using globalization. 
eg: we want to modify the text 'Select Files'.
